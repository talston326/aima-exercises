Consider the Bayesian network in
FigureÂ <a class="insideBookFigRef" target="_blank" href="https://aimacode.github.io/figures/burglary-figure.png">burglary-figure.</a><br>

1.  If no evidence is observed, are ${Burglary}$ and ${Earthquake}$
    independent? Prove this from the numerical semantics and from the
    topological semantics.<br>

2.  If we observe ${Alarm}{{\,=\,}}{true}$, are ${Burglary}$ and
    ${Earthquake}$ independent? Justify your answer by calculating
    whether the probabilities involved satisfy the definition of
    conditional independence.
