For the $4\times 3$ world shown in
Figure <a class="insideBookFigRef" target="_blank" href="https://aimacode.github.io/figures/sequential-decision-world-figure.png">sequential-decision-world-figure</a>, calculate
which squares can be reached from (1,1) by the action sequence
$[{Right},{Right},{Right},{Up},{Up}]$ and with what
probabilities. Explain how this computation is related to the prediction
task (see Section <a class="sectionRef" title="" href="#">general-filtering-section</a>) for a
hidden Markov model.
